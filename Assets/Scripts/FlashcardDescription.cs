    //Merriam Webster definitions
    private string eyes = "A specialized light-sensitive sensory structure of animals that in nearly all vertebrates, most arthropods, and some mollusks is the image-forming organ of sight";
    private string skin = "The integument of an animal (such as a fur-bearing mammal or a bird) separated from the body usually with its hair or feathers";
    private string respiratory = "A system of organs functioning in respiration and in humans consisting especially of the nose, nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs";
    private string circulatory = "";
    private string muscle = "A body tissue consisting of long cells that contract when stimulated and produce motion";
    private string skeleton = "The bony or more or less cartilaginous framework supporting the soft tissues and protecting the internal organs of a vertebrate";
    private string nerves = "The bodily system that in vertebrates is made up of the brain and spinal cord, nerves, ganglia, and parts of the receptor organs and that receives and interprets stimuli and transmits impulses to the effector organs";
    private string lymph = "The part of the circulatory system that is concerned especially with scavenging fluids and proteins which have escaped from cells and tissues and returning them to the blood, with the phagocytic removal of cellular debris and foreign material, and with the immune response and that consists especially of lymphoid tissue, lymph, and lymph-transporting vessels";
    private string pancreas = "A large lobulated gland of vertebrates that secretes digestive enzymes and the hormones insulin and glucagon";
    private string spinalCord = "The cord of nervous tissue that extends from the brain lengthwise along the back in the spinal canal, gives off the pairs of spinal nerves, carries impulses to and from the brain, and serves as a center for initiating and coordinating many reflex acts";
    private string smallIntestine = "The narrow part of the intestine that lies between the stomach and colon, consists of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, secretes digestive enzymes, and is the chief site of the digestion of food into small molecules which are absorbed into the body";
    private string largeIntestine = "The more terminal division of the vertebrate intestine that is wider and shorter than the small intestine, typically divided into cecum, colon, and rectum, and concerned especially with the resorption of water and the formation of feces";
    private string spleen = "A highly vascular ductless organ that is located in the left abdominal region near the stomach or intestine of most vertebrates and is concerned with final destruction of red blood cells, filtration and storage of blood, and production of lymphocytes";
    private string stomach = "A saclike expansion of the digestive tract of a vertebrate that is located between the esophagus and duodenum and typically consists of a simple often curved sac with an outer serous covering, a strong muscular wall that contracts rhythmically, and an inner mucous membrane lining that contains gastric glands";
    private string thyroid = "a large bilobed endocrine gland of vertebrates lying at the anterior base of the neck and producing especially the hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine";
    private string lungs = "one of the usually paired compound saccular thoracic organs that constitute the basic respiratory organs of an air-breathing vertebrate";
    private string liver = "a large very vascular glandular organ of vertebrates that secretes bile and causes important changes in many of the substances contained in the blood (as by converting sugars into glycogen which it stores up until required and by forming urea)";
    private string larynx = "the modified upper part of the trachea of air-breathing vertebrates that in humans, most other mammals, and some amphibians and reptiles contains the vocal cords";
    private string heart = "a hollow muscular organ of vertebrate animals that by its rhythmic contraction acts as a force pump maintaining the circulation of the blood";
    private string kidney = "one of a pair of vertebrate organs situated in the body cavity near the spinal column that excrete waste products of metabolism and consist chiefly of nephrons by which urine is secreted, collected, and discharged into a main cavity from which it is conveyed by the ureter to the bladder";
    private string gallbladder = "a membranous muscular sac in which bile from the liver is stored";
    private string colon = "the part of the large intestine that extends from the cecum to the rectum";
    private string brain = "the portion of the vertebrate central nervous system enclosed in the skull and continuous with the spinal cord through the foramen magnum that is composed of neurons and supporting and nutritive structures (such as glia) and that integrates sensory information from inside and outside the body in controlling autonomic function (such as heartbeat and respiration), in coordinating and directing correlated motor responses, and in the process of learning";
    private string bladder = "a membranous sac in animals that serves as the receptacle of a liquid or contains gas";
    private string arteries = "any of the tubular branching muscular- and elastic-walled vessels that carry blood from the heart through the body";
    private string veins = "any of the tubular branching vessels that carry blood from the capillaries toward the heart";
